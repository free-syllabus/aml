### Activities
1. Guess the game
   * Team is presented with unknown game and input/output vector dimensions for each move
   * Mentor is evaluating moves (input vector) and answer with output vector and score (win, lose, invalid-move, valid-move)
   * Team tries to find winning strategy according to previous moves (and identify game if possible)
  
### Reasoning
