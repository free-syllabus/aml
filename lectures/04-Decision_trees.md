### Activities
1. Guess animals by their attributes [70 minutes]
   * Create decision tree with selected attributes for top20 animals with animals in leafs
   * Are you able to count Gini unpurity?
   * Across teams: Game that tests identification of new animals (outliers)
     * Try to find out "new" animals that will identified almost-correctly by your tree but not by others
   * [optional] Can you use any boosting methods to split this complex tree?
