## Hypothesis Testing

### Required Study Materials

1. **[Statistics 101 - PL09](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeGtxpvyG-IZRHcZcOy12jp7ywuRbE7l)** (video:275min) by Brandon Foltz  <br>
  Please take a loot at first 12 videos. Focus on *hypothesis*, *z-score*, *t-score*, *p-value* and relevant background information.
  If your knowledge of statististics exceed our expectation then please just take time to look at English terminology.

### Activities

* Who is better teacher?

* Coin toss experiment?
   * Test if probability of eagle/head side of the coin toss is same?
   * Can we generate hypothesis after looking at the data?

* Are dices false or not?
   * What is the difference between dice (6 sides) vs coin (2 sides)?

* How much data we need to do A/B testing of our ads?
   * Impact of the CTR (clickthrough rate)
   * Can we do it in a correct way?

* @todo: detect if chess player is cheating or not based on the difference between optimal moves and history

### Reasoning

* Final goal is to be able to measure quality of our models after making changes. In order to do that, we have to have 
basic understanding of what is statistically significant.
