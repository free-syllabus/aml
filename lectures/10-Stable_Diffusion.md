## Stable Diffusion

### Required Study Materials

1. **[Stable Diffusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7rMfsA24Ls&ab_channel=JeremyHoward)** (video:90min) by Jeremy Howard  <Br>
   The video is quite long and some parts are not necessary. So focus on the stable diffusion explanation (starting from Stable diffusion explained, 45:00) and you can skip the beginning part.

### Alternative Study Materials
1. **[Illustrated Stable Diffusion](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/)** (blogpost) by Jay Alammar

### Activities

#### 1. What is hard for Stable Diffusion?


It's pretty easy to get a beautiful picture from Stable Diffusion depicting *"Astronaut riding a horse"*.
But how hard ris to get a picture of *"Horse riding an astronaut"*? Let's try it out. 
Run any of the available instances of stable diffusion and try to get the best picture.
A painter would not have problem painting a picture like this, why Diffusion has? Think about it.

#### 2. Digging into table Diffusion pipeline

Have a look at the [notebook](/on-session/10_Stable_Diffusion/stable_diffusion_exercise.ipynb) with Stable Diffusion. 
Your goal is to understand the code and be able to modify it to implement *guidance by negative prompt*.

#### 3. Quiz

Have a look at this [quiz](https://www.irozhlas.cz/veda-technologie/fotografie-obrazky-umela-inteligence-aplikace-rozdil_2304050600_pik). 
You will try to recognize which pictures are real and which generated with AI. How did you do? Is it easy or not?

### Reasoning

* get oriented in somebody else's code
* understand the basic steps in Stable Diffusion pipeline
* thinking about strengths and limitations
