### Activities

* Creation of annotation manual and annotation of border-line data [pairs]
  * An example is to annotate newspaper articles to be serious / tabloid; politically left / right
  * Create annotation manual with at most 10 rules
  * Select 10 "other" articles to annotate. Work individually using your manuals
  * Count IAA and accuracy
  * Give your "evaluation" articles and guidelines to other pair and let them annotate and evaluate results
  * Compare results between creator of guideline and new annotators
  
* Annotation of video
  * [teacher] Explain that creating annotation guideline is similar to engineering of features
  * (alternative) Select features that can be annotated by you and might be valuable when annotating communication between dogs
  * (alternative) Select features that can be annotated by you and might be valuable when annotating communication using sign language
     * There are "signs" with meaning and movements that just connect them (without additional meaning)
     * Sign language allows to be more precise when showing length/happyness/...
     * Play video of song with sign language interpretation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP2EfJGQY3A)
     * e.g. angle between hands might matter; how to measure the distance between hands
 
* Annotation of smiling faces
  * Select features that can be annotated by you and might be value when annotating if person is smiling
  * [teacher] Explain importance of diversity in datasets and difference between smiles across cultures/ages/gender/...
