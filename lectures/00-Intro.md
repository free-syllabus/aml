## Intro

### Introduce Applied Machine Learning

* Basic principles of the course
* Study materials at home
* Send questions before "live sessions"
* Activity points, datacamp tasks and final exam
* Explain group projects

### On Session Materials
1. [How to generate images using Midjourney](/on-session/00-Intro/midjourney_discord.pdf)

### Activities
* Adhesive stickers with student's name 

* Get to know each other
  * **Classic speed dating [~20 minutes]**
    * 4 rounds of 3 minutes with different partners. Main question is *why are you here and what do you expect*
    * Point to every student, ask for name and his/her partners should say single sentence about selected student. 
  * **Speed dating with Midjourney [~40 minutes; requires laptop]**
    * Explain how to use Midjourney: live demonstration + [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pra4v9EdUrsGMzMufoSOUYhc-2mkzPe40h4BjEp9iOw/edit?usp=sharing)
    * 2-3 rounds of 5 minutes with different partners. Main question is *why are you here and what do you expect* but also asks for other info suitable for image generation (e.g. hobbies, favourite animal)
    * For each round generate portrait of your partner using obtained information via [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/home/)
    * (idea) Create gallery of generated pictures?

* **Ice breaker questions [~30 minutes]**
  * Create group of 3 students that you did not meet at speed dating; Shuffle groups before each of the question.
  * 10 minutes for group preparation for every question. 
  * *Where do you see difference between AI and ML?*
  * *What will be impact of AI/ML at 2050?*
  * Each group represents their position. It is not required (or intended) to have strong disagreements. 

* (idea) **Show AI pipeline**
  * Create a pipeline of user-oriented AI tools to produce "media output" (podcast / short movie / ...)
  * Start with prompt and create script (e.g. chatGPT)
  * Generate voice reading that script (e.g. ElevenLabs)
  * Add images/video (e.g. Midjourney)

### Reasoning
The first goal of this session is to inform students that course will be useful but not easy. It is better for them to quit in the first week. 

The second goal is to show that will be talk to each other a lot and we should know each other (= speed dating activities)

The last goal is to show that we will use the latest tools but we will not rely on computers too much on live sessions.
