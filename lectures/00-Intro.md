## Intro

### Introduce Applied Machine Learning

* Basic principles
* Study materials at home
* Send questions before "live sessions"
* Activity points
* Group projects
* @todo: add reasoning

### Activities

* Speed dating + generate portrait of your partner (via [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/home/)) using obtained info
  - @todo send an email to bring their laptops
  - explain how to use Midjourney: live demonstration + [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pra4v9EdUrsGMzMufoSOUYhc-2mkzPe40h4BjEp9iOw/edit?usp=sharing) with steps uploaded in interactive sylabus @todo upload to sylabus
  - cca 5 min for one "date", know your partner's name + any other info interesting for your picture (eg. hobbies, favourite animal)
  - @todo think about what to do with the pictures - make some gallery?
  - reasoning: meet people from the course, use currently trendy AI tool
* @todo: rule based system (?)
* @todo: use current AI tools to see where we are heading 

### Reasoning

* @todo: importance of ability to test if results of our models are really better or it is just coincidence. 
* @todo: A/B tests materials
