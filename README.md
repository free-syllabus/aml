# Course: Applied Machine Learning

This course is supported by [Red Hat Research](https://research.redhat.com/) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

Red Hat Research helps us with organizing the course itself and providing a lot of support that allows us to do our job better. We
want to make syllabus (and other materials) available for everyone and we believe that free/open source approach should be more used also
in education.

We are using Datacamp for the Classroom in this machine learning course because it provides perfect opportunity for getting into the
"craft" and they are doing it for free, so find out more at [datacamp.com/groups/education](https://datacamp.com/groups/education)
