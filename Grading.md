## Grading system

This course consist of several multiple parts that are graded separately and you have to pass all of them.
The final mark will be rounded to the better grade e.g. A+A+C is A at the end. 

#### Activity points
Activity points are obtained for active participation in the lectures.
Usually there is 1-2 activities for small groups per lecture. We guarantee that you can get 20 activity points on the live sessions.
You can also obtain activity points for your activities outside lectures.

It is preferable that you will combine multiple types of tasks (otherwise I might not accept them all). Possible tasks (not limited) of yours activities:
* DataCamp course / task
* ML/AI news presented for rest of the students (5 minutes)
* Improve my lectures / Prepare your own
* Write essay / blogpost about ML

**DataCamp homeworks**

DataCamp lectures should be finished in two weeks before our lecture starts. Penalization is based on the days where "day" is defined as 24 hours (+30 min delta)

Grading: <10, 14 days> C; <5, 9 days> B; <4, 0 days) A

**Group project**

It is expected that you will get through all milestones and pass the final presentation. 

Grading: pass / fail

**Question Points**

You are expected to ask at least **three** questions during term. You can ask about material that was not clear, ask guests, ... It is possible to ask via email before 
lecture so yours identity is not visible to others. So, you don't have to worry about asking "stupid" questions. 

Grading: pass / fail

**Final exam**
Final exam is dialogue between you and us (live or online). You will explain (at high level) something what we were talking about. You can have as much attempts as
you wish as long as I can see that you are working on getting better. Failed attempts are not in any evidence as the goal is that you understand topic at the end.

Grading: A, B, C and F
